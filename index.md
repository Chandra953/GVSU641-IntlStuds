## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an interactive web application for a jewelry store, providing a seamless user experience for browsing and uploading images. 

The website showcases the store's collection through image galleries, allowing users to view products in high quality. The project focuses on a smooth image slider for featured products. Users can register, log in, and upload images of jewelry pieces. These images are displayed in a dynamic slider format on the homepage, offering an elegant browsing experience. 

The project will utilize modern web technologies with a focus on security through JWT-based authentication and real-time chat functionality with the store owner.

## Anticipated Technologies
- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **File Uploads:** Multer
- **Version Control:** Git

## Method/Approach
- **Environment Setup:** Set up a React project and connect it to a Node.js backend.
- **UI/UX Design:** Focus on gathering information from the client and using modern web practices for smooth interaction.
- **User Authentication:** Implement JWT authentication to secure user login and registration.
- **Image Upload and Storage:** Use Multer to handle image uploads, storing them in MongoDB and displaying them in a slider.
- **Testing and Deployment:** Conduct performance and security testing, followed by deployment.

## Estimated Timeline
- **Weeks 1-2:** Requirements gathering, feasibility analysis, and testing technologies.
- **Week 3:** Set up development environment and implement authentication.
- **Week 4-5:** Implement image upload and carousel functionality.
- **Weeks 6-8:** Testing, debugging, deployment, and project documentation.

## Anticipated Challenges
- **User Management:** Efficiently managing admin and buyer roles.
- **Image Handling:** Dealing with large image files, possibly requiring compression techniques.
- **Security:** Securely managing JWT tokens and encrypting sensitive data.
